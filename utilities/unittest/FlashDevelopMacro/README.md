# FlashDevelop RunTestCase macro
This macro is designed for FlashDevelop to run only one unit test class or a test function (instead of the whole suit)

# Installation

Download the FDZ and double-click to install.

If FlashDevelop was already running you'll have to restart it to see the macros appear in the Macros menu.

# Usage

Go into any of your hexUnit test function, test class, test suite, and press Ctrl+Alt+T to run the test.
